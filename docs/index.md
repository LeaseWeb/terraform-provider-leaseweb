# Leaseweb Provider

The Leaseweb provider is used to interact with the many
resources supported by Leaseweb. The provider needs to be configured with the
proper credentials before it can be used.

!>
This provider is currently considered in a **beta version**.
The documented features are expected to work however several things such as
better logging and error reporting will be improved later on.
As we gather feedback from our customers, it is possible that some items
might change in a non backward compatible way as we continue our improvements
towards a stable 1.0.0 version.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    leaseweb = {
      version = "0.0.1"
      source  = "git.ocom.com/infra/leaseweb"
    }
  }
}

provider "leaseweb" {}

resource "leaseweb_dedicated_server" "web" {
  reference = "web"
}
```
